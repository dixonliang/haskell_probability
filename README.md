# Exploration of probability Package for Haskell

This repo contains an exploration exercise of the probability package in Haskell. The package was developed by Martin Erwig and Steve Kollmansberger of Oregon State University. 

The documentation for the package can be found here: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/probability
The original paper for the package can be found here: http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~erwig/papers/PFP_JFP06.pdf

With the use of this package, we can leverage the advantages of Haskell to solve discrete probability problems with efficent and concise programs. I have explored the package contributing the following files.

2) Coin Flip
